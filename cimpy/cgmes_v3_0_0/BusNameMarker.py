class BusNameMarker(IdentifiedObject):
	'''
	Used to apply user standard names to TopologicalNodes. Associated with one or more terminals that are normally connected with the bus name.    The associated terminals are normally connected by non-retained switches. For a ring bus station configuration, all BusbarSection terminals in the ring are typically associated.   For a breaker and a half scheme, both BusbarSections would normally be associated.  For a ring bus, all BusbarSections would normally be associated.  For a "straight" busbar configuration, normally only the main terminal at the BusbarSection would be associated.

	:Terminal: The terminals associated with this bus name marker. Default: "list"
	:priority: Priority of bus name marker for use as topology bus name.  Use 0 for do not care.  Use 1 for highest priority.  Use 2 as priority is less than 1 and so on. Default: 0
	:ReportingGroup: The reporting group to which this bus name marker belongs. Default: None
